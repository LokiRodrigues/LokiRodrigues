## Hello! Iâ€™m a 23-year-old aspiring software developer from Manaus, Brazil. Currently, Iâ€™m pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development at Uninorte ðŸŽ“, where Iâ€™m honing my skills in programming, problem-solving, and software development.

When Iâ€™m not coding or studying, youâ€™ll often find me immersed in the world of online gaming ðŸŽ® or watching live streams of people playing games. Iâ€™m a huge fan of The Big Bang Theory ðŸ“º and Dragon Ball Z.

Iâ€™m passionate about technology and always eager to learn new things.
